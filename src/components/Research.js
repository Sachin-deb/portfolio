      <p>
        My research focuses on improving optimization techniques for federated learning, with a specific emphasis on addressing challenges posed by Non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed) datasets. Below are the key highlights of my work:
      </p>
      <ul className="research-highlights">
        <li>
          Developed a <strong>hybrid optimization algorithm</strong> combining gradient descent and simulated annealing to enhance federated learning performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proposed a <strong>maximum likelihood-based client weighting method</strong> to dynamically shuffle client contributions, achieving improved aggregation accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaluated the model on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, achieving a global model test accuracy of <strong>71%</strong>, significantly outperforming baseline methods like FedAvg (61â€“65%).
        </li>
